## Overview
This is a simple To-Do List application built in Python. It allows users to manage and organize their tasks efficiently through a graphical user interface (GUI) created using the Tkinter library.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** The core programming language used to develop the application.
- **Tkinter:** A standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit. It provides the elements (like buttons, labels, and entry fields) required to build the GUI.
- **JSON:** Used for persistent storage of tasks. Tasks are stored in a JSON file ([tasks.json](tasks.json)) which allows for data retrieval between sessions.

## How It Works
**1.  Launching the Application**
- Run the Python script **([to-do-list.py](to-do-list.py))**.
- The main window of the application will appear.

**2.  Adding a Task**
- Type the task name in the provided input field.
- Click the "Add Task" button.
- The task will be added to the list.

**3.  Marking a Task as Complete**
- Select a task from the list.
- Click the "Mark as Complete" button.
- The selected task will be marked as complete.

**4.  Deleting a Task**
- Select a task from the list.
- Click the "Delete Task" button.
- The selected task will be removed from the list.

**5.  Saving and Loading Tasks**
- Tasks are stored in a JSON file ([tasks.json](tasks.json)) in the same directory as the script. This allows tasks to persist between sessions.

**6.  Exiting the Application**
- Click the close button on the application window.

## How to Use
**1.  Clone the Repository**
- Clone this repository to your local machine.

**2.  Install Dependencies**
- Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
- No additional packages are required as Tkinter is a standard library in Python.

**3.  Run the Application**
- Execute the Python script **[to-do-list.py](to-do-list.py)** to launch the application.

**4.  Interact with the GUI**
- Follow the instructions provided in the "[How It Works](https://github.com/guptaparas061/CODSOFT/edit/main/README.md#how-it-works)" section above to add, complete, and delete tasks.

**5.  Closing the Application**
- Simply close the application window to exit.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement additional features such as task prioritization, due dates, and categories.
- Add user authentication and the ability to have multiple user accounts.
- Improve the UI/UX with more advanced GUI components and styles. <br>
